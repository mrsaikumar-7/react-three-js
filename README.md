🌐 Diving into the World of 3D Web Design! 🚀

Excited to share the first glimpse of my latest venture into 3D web design - introducing the "3D Shoe Customizer" project! 👟🎨

🎯 Project Overview:

Embarking on the journey of 3D web design, I've created a dynamic webpage allowing you to explore a shoe in three dimensions. Navigate, rotate, and scale the entire shoe with an interactive interface. 🔄🔍

🎨 Customization Galore:

The standout feature? Full customization! Pick your favorite colors for different components of the shoe – mesh, laces, inner mesh, base, and more. The color picker provides an intuitive way to personalize each element in real-time. 🌈✨

🛠️ Tech Stack:

Built using React.js Three.js and blender this project was a fantastic opportunity to blend creativity with cutting-edge technology.

🤔 Challenges and Solutions:

Overcoming challenges in rendering, interactivity, and ensuring a seamless customization experience, every roadblock was a chance to refine my skills and enhance user experience.

🌟 Next Steps:

This is just the beginning! I'm eager to expand on this project, exploring more features and pushing the boundaries of 3D web design.

👉 Check it out and step into the world of interactive 3D shoe exploration! Your feedback is invaluable. 🚀
